WIN32 support

Alignment bug in hash.c

 Anders Thulin <ath@algonet.se>

in.h missing in "configure" test programs. Damn, if a include file X needs 
structures defined in Y, why doesn't X include Y ? Stupid Solaris.

dangerous typo found in libpcap.c, in code handling source routed frames 

 Keiji Takeda <keiji@sfc.keio.ac.jp>

Ported to Win32 C++, addition of info parameter to callbacks, addition of 
CLibnidsState class to allow multiple instances of libnids to coexist in 
the same process, incorporation of an unofficial patch to allow tracking 
of already established TCP connections, migration of some calls to their 
Windows secure versions (i.e. strcpy to strcpy_s), project now compiles 
under Visual Studio 2010 with no warnings at W4, plus countless formatting 
changes to look better in VS2010. Also, sorry, but I broke linux support 
and ended up simply removing much of the Linux specific code.

Libnids uses libpcap and libnet libraries:

Libnids emulates algorithms present in Linux 2.0.36 kernel. The files
ip_fragment.c and ip_options.c are the modified respective files from Linux 
2.0.36 kernel source. The asm code used for checksums computing is taken
from Linux 2.2.10 kernel source.
